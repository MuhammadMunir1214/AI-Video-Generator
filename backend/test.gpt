args: dir: Directory to save the files to

1. Browse to ${url} and read the page contents throughly.
2. Create a tldr text version of it for an instagram reel or a tiktok video. No emojis, max 50 words, do not repeat the same words multiple times.
3. Split the created text into 3 different parts, not repeating words and save the texts to "${dir}/story-${INDEX}.txt"
4. For each text part, come up with a keyword or a phrase for a 1024x1792 b-roll image, generate and save the images them to: "${dir}/b-roll-${INDEX}.png" Make sure you download and save the image as a binary file, not the URL.
5. For each text part, generate speech files and save them to: "${dir}/voiceover-${INDEX}". Don't pass the file type, use the default value. Save the files before moving to the next step.
6. After the mp3 files have been saved, run speech2text for all 3 *.mp3 files inside ${dir} and save results to 3 separate files in ${dir}/transcription-${INDEX}.txt.

Leqembi is considered a breakthrough for a progressive disease that has proven notoriously hard to treat. Leqembi is a monoclonal antibody that moderately slows the decline in memory and thinking in patients in the earliest stages of Alzheimer's. Only a narrow swath of the nearly 7 million U.S. patients with the disease are in those early phases. Still, the drug carries risks of brain swelling and bleeding. Some neurologists and other experts also say patients taking the drug haven't had it long enough to see a substantial clinical benefit, which was observed at 18 months in Biogen and Eisai's late-stage trial.

Leqembi, an Alzheimer's drug from Biogen and Eisai, isn't a cure but promises to give patients more time to live independently. Missie Meeks, diagnosed with early-stage Alzheimer's, started Leqembi in September 2023. Despite initial hurdles, she now takes infusions every two weeks. Leqembi moderately slows memory decline in early-stage patients but carries risks like brain swelling. The drug's rollout faces challenges like reimbursement issues and finding neurologists. Some doctors are cautious due to its risks. However, patients like Meeks find the process worth it for more time with loved ones.

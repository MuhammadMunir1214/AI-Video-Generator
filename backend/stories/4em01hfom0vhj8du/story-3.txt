The prosecution has said the case has national and international interest, and that the case has been covered plenty in Boise, so a change of venue would not solve any problem. The relatives of victim Kaylee Goncalves said they're "incredibly disappointed" that the venue will be changed. The trial is set to begin on June 2, 2025, and run until Aug. 29, 2025. Kohberger is accused of fatally stabbing four University of Idaho students in an off-campus house in the early hours of Nov. 13, 2022.

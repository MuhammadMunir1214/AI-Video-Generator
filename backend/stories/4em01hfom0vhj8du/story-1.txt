The venue will be changed in the University of Idaho quadruple murder trial, Judge John Judge has ruled. The judge said, "Considering the undisputed evidence presented by the defense, the extreme nature of the news coverage in this case, and the smaller population in Latah County, the defense has met the rather low standard of demonstrating 'a reasonable likelihood' that prejudicial news coverage will compromise a fair trial in Latah County. Thus, the Court will grant Kohberger's motion to change venue for presumed prejudice."

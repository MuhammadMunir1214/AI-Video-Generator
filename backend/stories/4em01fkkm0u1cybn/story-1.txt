Boeing and its Seattle-area workers’ union reached a labor deal that averts a strike that could have started within a week. The deal includes 25% in pay increases over four years. The union represents more than 30,000 workers in Boeing’s factories that build its airplanes. Workers still need to approve the deal, but avoiding the strike is a win for new CEO Kelly Ortberg who has vowed to get the company back on solid footing as it wades through safety and quality crises. A vote is scheduled for Sept. 12.

Leqembi, an Alzheimer's drug from Biogen and Eisai, isn't a cure but promises to give patients more time to live independently. Missie Meeks, diagnosed with early-stage Alzheimer's, started Leqembi in September 2023. Despite logistical hurdles, she now takes biweekly infusions. Leqembi moderately slows memory decline in early-stage patients but carries risks like brain swelling and bleeding. The drug's rollout faces challenges like reimbursement issues and diagnostic test requirements. Some doctors are cautious due to its risks and uncertain benefits. However, patients like Meeks find the treatment worth it for extended normalcy.

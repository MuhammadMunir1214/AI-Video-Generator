Leqembi, an Alzheimer's drug from Biogen and Eisai, isn't a cure but promises to give patients more time to live independently. Missie Meeks, diagnosed with early-stage Alzheimer's, started Leqembi in September 2023. Despite logistical hurdles, she now takes biweekly infusions. Leqembi moderately slows memory decline in early-stage patients but carries risks like brain swelling. The drug's rollout faces challenges, including insurance issues and finding neurologists. Some patients and caregivers find the process worth it for the extended quality of life. Sales are rising, with 5,000 people taking the drug as of May 2023.

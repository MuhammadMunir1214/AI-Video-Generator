Diagnosing early Alzheimer's is arduous, often taking years. Patients need PET or spinal fluid tests to confirm amyloid plaques in the brain. MRI scans check for other brain diseases and microbleeds, which could disqualify patients from Leqembi. Some hospitals require genetic testing for the APOE4 gene variant. A panel of experts then decides eligibility. Even with a diagnosis, insurance issues can delay treatment. Medicare covers Leqembi, but younger patients may struggle with coverage. Infusion clinics are scarce, adding another hurdle. Eisai and Biogen are working on more convenient forms of the drug to ease the burden on patients.

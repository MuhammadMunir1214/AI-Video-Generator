Patients start biweekly infusions of Leqembi once covered. Some neurologists lack infusion clinics, forcing patients to travel. Eisai and Biogen aim to approve a monthly maintenance dose and a weekly injectable form. Infusions can feel like therapy sessions, offering comfort through shared experiences. Side effects like brain swelling are monitored with regular MRI scans. Leqembi has been well-tolerated, with some cases of manageable side effects. The drug reduced cognitive decline by 27% after 18 months in trials. Patients hope Leqembi will extend their ability to live independently and perform daily activities.

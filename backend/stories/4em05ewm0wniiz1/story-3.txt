Meeks' experience also points to the new and complicated system associated with taking Leqembi, which has hampered the drug's rollout. There are bottlenecks related to reimbursement uncertainties, diagnostic test requirements, the need for regular brain scans and difficulties finding neurologists. Some hospitals and clinics simply aren't equipped to accommodate the new flow of patients who could take the drug. Some doctors are also reluctant to prescribe Leqembi, citing their concerns about its risks and skepticism around how much it meaningfully benefits patients. Some experts say those issues partly reflect the steep learning curve that comes with a new drug such as Leqembi, which has ushered in a new era for the Alzheimer's treatment space.

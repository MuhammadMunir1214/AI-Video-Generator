args: url: Link to the article or page
args: dir: Directory to save the files to

1. Browse to ${url} and read the page contents throughly.
2. Create a tldr text version of it for an instagram reel or a tiktok video. No emojis, max 50 words, do not repeat the same words multiple times.
3. Split the created text into 3 different parts, not repeating words and save the texts to "${dir}/story-${INDEX}.txt"
4. For each text part, generate speech files and save them to: "${dir}/voiceover-${INDEX}". Don't pass the file type, use the default value. Save the files before moving to the next step.
5. After the audio_file.mp3 files have been saved, use those audio files found in ${dir}, run speech2text for all 3 *.mp3 files inside ${dir} and save results to 3 separate files in ${dir}/transcription-${INDEX}.txt.
